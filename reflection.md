- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Nice when making similar classes, I thought it was fun having a base then adding methods to the individual classes off of house. I can see how it is more organized and efficient. I thought this assignment helped me get more comfortable with java through of the repetition of different classes.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I don't know why addTitle isn't working how it's supposed to. I wasn't able to addent TA hours to help me firgure it out. I definatly am getting better at looking things up and understanding things ex. Hashtable.
